## Overview

Organizations process thousands of documents daily—purchase orders, invoices, contracts, and forms—each containing critical business information. Manual processing is slow, error-prone, and expensive. Traditional document processing solutions require extensive upfront configuration and struggle with document format variations.

This guidance demonstrates how to build an intelligent document processing (IDP) system using **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** and AI agents. Unlike traditional IDP solutions, this agentic approach:

- **Learns and adapts**: AI agents iteratively improve extraction instructions based on validation feedback
- **Handles format variations**: Automatically adjusts to different document layouts without manual configuration
- **Self-corrects errors**: Troubleshooter agents identify and fix extraction issues automatically
- **Scales horizontally**: Add new document types by providing sample documents and schemas

Key benefits:
- **Automated document classification and data extraction** using vector similarity search
- **Self-improving accuracy** through agent-based troubleshooting and instruction refinement
- **Minimal upfront configuration** - provide sample documents and JSON schemas
- **Serverless, scalable architecture** built on AWS managed services
- **Lower maintenance costs** compared to traditional commercial IDP solutions

The system uses a multi-agent orchestration pattern where specialized agents collaborate to process documents:
- **Analyzer Agent**: Extracts text and identifies sender, document type (PO, invoice, etc.)
- **Matcher Agent**: Finds similar documents using vector search
- **Instructions Agent**: Generates extraction prompts from sample documents (training workflow)
- **Extractor Agent**: Extracts structured data following instructions
- **Validator Agent**: Validates extracted data against schemas and business rules
- **Troubleshooter Agent**: Analyzes validation failures and suggests fixes (processing workflow)
- **Instructions Fixer Agent**: Updates extraction instructions based on troubleshooter feedback (training workflow)
- **Save Instructions Agent**: Persists successful instructions for reuse

- Asia Pacific (Tokyo) - ap-northeast-1

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Configure AWS credentials

```bash
aws configure
```

### 2. Bootstrap CDK (first time only)

```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

### 3. Set up Python environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install UI dependencies

```bash
cd ui/orchestrator
npm install
cd ../..
```

### 5. Configure admin email (optional)

To skip the email prompt during deployment, add your admin email to `cdk.context.json`:

```json
{
  "agenticidp": {
    "development": {
      "environment": "dev",
      "app_name": "agenticidp",
      "admin_email": "your-email@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Deploy the solution

**Quick Deploy (Recommended)**:
```bash
uv run deploy.py
```

This automated script:
1. Deploys all CDK stacks (Core, Gateway, Aurora, Agent, UI Orchestrator, UI infrastructure)
2. Fetches CloudFormation outputs
3. Builds the UI with correct configuration
4. Deploys UI to S3/CloudFront

**Options**:
```bash
uv run deploy.py --env prod    # Deploy to production
uv run deploy.py --skip-ui     # Deploy only CDK stacks (skip UI build)
uv run deploy.py --admin-email your-email@example.com  # Specify admin email
uv run deploy.py --help        # Show all options
```

**Manual Deployment (Alternative)**:

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Deploy CDK stacks:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
   ```

2. Build and deploy UI:
   ```bash
   cd ui/orchestrator
   npm run deploy:cdk:dev
   ```

**Deployed stacks**:
- **AgenticIDP-Core-Dev**: S3 buckets (documents, vectors), Cognito, DynamoDB, Parameter Store
- **AgenticIDP-Gateway-Dev**: Lambda functions, ECR repositories, Bedrock AgentCore Gateway
- **AgenticIDP-Aurora-Dev**: Aurora DSQL cluster, sample data loader
- **AgenticIDP-Agent-Dev**: Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, agent containers
- **AgenticIDP-UIOrchestr-Dev**: API Gateway endpoints for UI
- **AgenticIDP-ModernUI-Dev**: React UI on S3/CloudFront

Deployment takes approximately 15-20 minutes.

## Deployment Validation

### 1. Verify CloudFormation stacks

- AgenticIDP-Core-Dev
- AgenticIDP-Gateway-Dev
- AgenticIDP-Aurora-Dev
- AgenticIDP-Agent-Dev
- AgenticIDP-UIOrchestr-Dev
- AgenticIDP-ModernUI-Dev

### 2. Verify DynamoDB tables

Navigate to DynamoDB console and confirm these tables exist:
- `idp-jobs` table with:
  - Partition key: `job_id` (STRING)
  - Three global secondary indexes
- `idp-instructions` table with:
  - Partition key: `instruction_id` (STRING)

### 3. Verify S3 buckets

Confirm these S3 buckets were created:
- `agenticidp-objects-{account-id}` - Document storage
- `agenticidp-instructions-{account-id}` - Extraction instructions
- `agenticidp-results-{account-id}` - Processing results
- `agenticidp-ui-{account-id}` - UI assets
- `agenticidp-vectors-{account-id}` - Vector embeddings (S3 Vector Bucket)

### 4. Verify Cognito User Pool

Navigate to Cognito console and confirm:
- User pool: `agenticidp-gateway-pool`
- App clients: `agenticidp-gateway-client`, `agenticidp-ui-client`

### 5. Verify Bedrock AgentCore Resources

Run the following CLI commands to verify resources:

```bash
# Verify gateway
aws bedrock-agent-runtime list-gateways

# Verify agent runtime
aws bedrock-agent-runtime list-agents
```

You should see `agenticidp-tool-gateway` and `agenticidp-orchestrator-agent` in the outputs.

### 6. Verify Aurora DSQL cluster

```bash
aws dsql list-clusters
```

You should see the `agenticidp-dsql-cluster` with status `ACTIVE`.

### 7. Verify Lambda functions

Navigate to Lambda console and confirm these functions exist:
- `agenticidp-po-validator` - Purchase order validation
- `agenticidp-matcher` - Document matching
- Additional tool functions for agent operations

### 8. Verify CloudFront distribution

Navigate to CloudFront console and confirm the distribution for the UI is deployed and enabled.

### 6. Get the UI URL

The UI URL is available in the CloudFormation outputs:
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name AgenticIDP-ModernUI-Dev \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UIUrl`].OutputValue' --output text
```

## Running the Guidance

This guidance includes sample purchase order documents for testing. We'll validate the system by uploading sample documents and verifying the processing results.

### 1. Access the web UI

After deployment completes, you will receive an email at the address provided during deployment. This email contains:
- CloudFront URL for the web application
- Username for initial login
- Temporary password

On first login, you will be required to change your password.

### 2. Upload sample documents

The application provides three main features:

#### Option 1: Process Document
- **Purpose**: Test document processing workflow
- **Usage**: Upload a file from the training folder
- **Sample files**: Use files from `infrastructure/sample_data/purchase_orders/training/`
- **What it does**: Processes the document through the complete agent workflow:
  1. **Analyzer Agent**: Extracts text and identifies sender name, address, and document type
  2. **Matcher Agent**: Searches for similar documents using vector similarity
  3. **Training workflow** (if no match found):
     - Instructions Agent → Extractor Agent → Validator Agent
     - If validation fails: Instructions Fixer Agent → Extractor Agent → Validator Agent (loop)
     - If validation passes: Save Instructions Agent
  4. **Processing workflow** (if match found):
     - Extractor Agent → Validator Agent
     - If validation fails: Troubleshooter Agent → Validator Agent (loop)
     - If validation passes: Complete

#### Option 2: Review Jobs and Instructions
- View processing history and results
- Inspect extraction instructions for each document type
- Review validation results and error messages
- Track document processing status

#### Option 3: Interactive Chat
- **Purpose**: Multi-turn conversation with the orchestrator agent
- **Usage**: Type messages and get responses
- **Sample questions**:
  - `what tools do you have`
  - `list instructions`
  - `what is the status of job XXXX`
  - `what went wrong with job XXXX, how can we update the instructions?`
- **What it does**: Maintains conversation context across multiple exchanges

### 3. Verify processing results

After uploading a document, you can:

1. **Check job status** in the "Review Jobs and Instructions" tab
2. **View extracted data** in the job details
3. **Inspect validation results** to see if data passed schema and business rule validation
4. **Review instructions** to see the extraction prompt generated for this document type

### 4. Understanding the agent workflows

**All documents start with**:
```
Upload → Analyzer Agent (extract text, identify sender/type) → Matcher Agent
```

**Training workflow** (new document type - no match found):
```
Matcher (no match) → Instructions Agent → Extractor → Validator
  ↓ (if validation fails)
Instructions Fixer → Extractor → Validator (loop until valid)
  ↓ (if validation passes)
Save Instructions Agent → Complete
```

**Processing workflow** (known document type - match found):
```
Matcher (match found) → Extractor → Validator
  ↓ (if validation fails)
Troubleshooter → Validator (loop until valid)
  ↓ (if validation passes)
Complete
```

**Key differences**:
- **Training**: Uses Instructions Agent and Instructions Fixer Agent to create/refine extraction instructions
- **Processing**: Uses Troubleshooter Agent to fix data issues without changing instructions

### 5. Sample validation results

The validation results include:
- Schema validation: Checks if extracted data matches expected JSON structure
- Business rule validation: Validates against reference data (vendors, products)
- Field-level validation: Checks individual field formats and values

## Agent Workflow Details

This guidance uses a multi-agent orchestration pattern where specialized agents collaborate to process documents. Each agent has a specific role in the workflow:

### 1. Analyzer Agent
**Purpose**: Extract text from documents and identify key metadata

**How it works**:
- Receives uploaded document (PDF, image, etc.)
- Uses Amazon Textract to extract text and layout information
- Analyzes extracted text to identify:
  - Sender name and address
  - Document type (purchase order, invoice, contract, etc.)
  - Document format characteristics
- Passes extracted text and metadata to Matcher Agent

**Tools used**:
- `textract_analyze_document`: Extract text and layout from documents
- `update_job`: Update job with extracted text and metadata

### 2. Matcher Agent
**Purpose**: Find similar documents using vector similarity search

**How it works**:
- Receives extracted text and metadata from Analyzer Agent
- Searches S3 Vector Bucket for similar documents using cosine similarity
- If match found (similarity > threshold):
  - Returns document ID and instructions S3 URI from matched record
  - Workflow proceeds to **Processing workflow** with existing instructions
- If no match found:
  - Workflow proceeds to **Training workflow** to create new instructions

**Tools used**:
- `search_documents`: Vector similarity search in S3 Vector Bucket
- `get_job`: Retrieve current job details from DynamoDB
- `update_job`: Update job with match results

### 3. Instructions Agent
**Purpose**: Generate extraction instructions for new document formats (Training workflow only)

**How it works**:
- Receives markdown text extracted from document
- Analyzes document structure and field patterns
- Uses minimal prompt approach: starts with JSON schema + essential clarifications
- Generates extraction instructions in markdown format
- Saves instructions to S3 at `instructions/{session_id}/extraction_prompt.md`
- Updates job with instructions S3 URI

**Key features**:
- Minimal initial instructions (schema-focused)
- Lets troubleshooter handle iterative refinements
- Avoids over-specification on first attempt

**Tools used**:
- `download_file`: Retrieve document text from S3
- `upload_file`: Save generated instructions to S3
- `update_job`: Update job with instructions URI

### 4. Extractor Agent
**Purpose**: Extract structured data from documents following instructions

**How it works**:
- Receives markdown document text and instructions S3 URI
- Downloads extraction instructions from S3
- Follows instructions to extract structured data
- Outputs JSON matching the schema defined in instructions
- Saves extracted data to S3
- Updates job with extracted data S3 URI

**Key features**:
- Instruction-driven extraction (not hardcoded rules)
- Produces structured JSON output
- Handles various document formats using same agent

**Tools used**:
- `download_file`: Retrieve document text and instructions from S3
- `upload_file`: Save extracted JSON to S3
- `update_job`: Update job with extraction results

### 5. Validator Agent
**Purpose**: Validate extracted data against schemas and business rules

**How it works**:
- Receives extracted data S3 URI
- Downloads extracted JSON
- Performs two-level validation:
  1. **Schema validation**: Checks JSON structure matches expected schema
  2. **Business rule validation**: Validates against reference data in Aurora DSQL
     - Vendor validation: Checks vendor exists and is active
     - Product validation: Checks SKUs exist and prices match
     - Line item validation: Validates quantities, units, totals
- Returns validation result with pass/fail status and detailed error messages

**Validation outcomes**:
- `VALID`: All checks passed, workflow complete
- `INVALID_SCHEMA`: Schema validation failed, proceed to Troubleshooter
- `INVALID_DATA`: Business rule validation failed, proceed to Troubleshooter

**Tools used**:
- `download_file`: Retrieve extracted JSON from S3
- `validate_purchase_order`: Validate against Aurora DSQL reference data
- `update_job`: Update job with validation results

### 6. Instructions Fixer Agent
**Purpose**: Fix extraction instructions when validation fails during training (Training workflow only)

**Model**: Claude 4.5 Sonnet

**How it works**:
- Receives validation error messages from Validator Agent
- Downloads original markdown document and current extraction instructions
- Analyzes validation errors against the PO schema:
  - Schema validation errors (missing fields, wrong types)
  - Content mapping errors (incorrect field mappings)
- Generates revised extraction instructions to fix the errors
- Saves updated instructions to S3 at `instructions/[session_id]/extraction_prompt.md`
- Updates job with new instructions URI
- Workflow returns to Extractor Agent with revised instructions

**Key features**:
- Iterative refinement during training phase
- Focuses on improving instructions, not fixing data
- Preserves working parts of instructions while fixing problems
- Uses PO schema as reference for correct structure

**Tools used**:
- `download_file`: Retrieve markdown document and current instructions
- `upload_file`: Save revised instructions to S3
- `get_job`: Retrieve validation error details
- `update_job`: Update job with new instructions URI

### 7. Troubleshooter Agent
**Purpose**: Fix extracted JSON data when validation fails during processing (Processing workflow only)

**Model**: Claude 4.5 Sonnet

**How it works**:
- Receives validation error messages from Validator Agent
- Downloads original markdown document and extracted JSON data
- Analyzes validation errors:
  - Schema errors: Fixes JSON structure to pass schema validation
  - Content errors: Ensures all data from markdown is correctly mapped
- Corrects the extracted JSON directly (does not modify instructions)
- Saves corrected JSON to S3
- Updates job with corrected data URI
- Workflow returns to Validator Agent with fixed JSON

**Key features**:
- One-time fix for individual documents during processing
- Fixes data, not instructions (instructions already exist)
- Handles both schema and content validation errors
- Uses PO schema as reference for correct structure

**Tools used**:
- `download_file`: Retrieve markdown document and extracted JSON
- `upload_file`: Save corrected JSON to S3
- `get_job`: Retrieve validation error details
- `update_job`: Update job with corrected data URI

### 8. Save Instructions Agent
**Purpose**: Persist successful extraction instructions for reuse

**How it works**:
- Receives validated extraction results and instructions
- Extracts document properties (type, sender, format characteristics)
- Creates or updates vector record in S3 Vector Bucket:
  - Stores document embeddings for similarity search
  - Links to instructions S3 URI
  - Includes metadata (document type, sender, processing workflow)
- Enables future documents with similar format to reuse instructions

**Key features**:
- Builds knowledge base of document formats
- Enables zero-shot processing of similar documents
- Reduces processing time for known formats

**Tools used**:
- `add_document`: Add new document to vector bucket
- `update_document`: Update existing document record
- `update_job`: Update job with document ID

**Key workflow characteristics**:
- **Analyzer always first**: Extracts text and identifies document metadata
- **Two distinct workflows**: Training (no match) vs Processing (match found)
- **Training workflow**: Instructions Agent → Extractor → Validator → Instructions Fixer (loop) → Save Instructions
- **Processing workflow**: Extractor → Validator → Troubleshooter (loop)
- **Knowledge persistence**: Save Instructions stores successful patterns for reuse
- **Self-improving**: Each failure improves instructions (training) or fixes data issues (processing)

## Next Steps

### Integration with External Systems
The document processing solution can be integrated with external business systems:
- **ERP integration**: Push purchase orders to SAP, Oracle, NetSuite
- **CRM integration**: Send extracted customer data to Salesforce, HubSpot
- **Content management**: Store processed documents in SharePoint, Box
- **Workflow automation**: Trigger approvals in ServiceNow, Jira

### Adding New Document Types
To add support for new document types:
1. Create JSON schema defining the expected output structure
2. Create a validator for your document type (identify what document charasteristics need validation)
3. Test with sample documents for your document type

### Custom Validation Rules
To add business-specific validation:
1. Modify the Validator Agent to include custom checks
2. Create validation rules in a validator Lambda

## Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:

### 1. Run cleanup script

```bash
uv run destroy.py
```

Or manually delete stacks:

```bash
cdk destroy --all
```

### 2. Verify cleanup

Check CloudFormation console to ensure all stacks are deleted:

## FAQ, known issues, additional considerations, and limitations

### FAQ

**Q: What document formats are supported?**
A: The system supports any document format that Amazon Textract can process, including PDF, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF. The agent-based approach adapts to different document layouts automatically.

**Q: How accurate is the extraction?**
A: Accuracy improves over time as the system processes more documents. Initial extraction may require 1-2 iterations of troubleshooting and instruction refinement. Once instructions are refined, similar documents achieve high accuracy.

**Q: Can I use different foundation models?**
A: Yes, you can configure different models in `utils/config.py`. The system is designed to work with any Amazon Bedrock foundation model that supports function calling.

**Q: How do I add new document types?**
A: To add support for new document types:
1. Create a JSON schema defining your document structure (see `agents/orchestratorgraph/doc_schema/purchase_order_schema.json` as example)
2. Create a validation Lambda function for your document type (see `infrastructure/lambda/po_validator/` for reference)
3. Update agent prompts that reference "purchase order" to your document type:
   - `agents/orchestratorgraph/prompts/po_minimal_instructions_prompt.txt`
   - `agents/orchestratorgraph/prompts/po_meta_system_prompt.txt`
   - Validator agent system prompt in `agents/orchestratorgraph/validator_agent.py`
4. Update validation logic - the current validator checks SKUs and vendors against synthetic demo data in Aurora DSQL. Replace this with your own business validation rules.

**Q: What happens if extraction fails repeatedly?**
A: The system allows up to 10 loop iterations per workflow (configured via `set_max_node_executions(10)` in the orchestrator). If validation continues to fail after 10 attempts, the workflow exits with an error status. Users can then:
- Use the chat functionality to review the job status and error messages
- Manually update extraction instructions via the UI
- Reprocess the failed job with updated instructions
The troubleshooter provides detailed analysis in each iteration to help identify and fix issues.

### Known Issues

- **Windows compatibility**: This solution works on Linux/macOS. Windows users may need WSL or Git Bash
- **Cold start latency**: First invocation of agents may take 30-60 seconds due to container cold starts
- **Token limits**: Very large documents may exceed model context windows

### Additional Considerations

When building your own Generative AI application, review and consider the [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs and Generative AI Apps](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/).

**Security best practices**:
- Enable MFA for Cognito users
- Restrict S3 bucket access using bucket policies
- Use VPC endpoints for private connectivity
- Enable CloudTrail logging for audit trails
- Rotate Cognito client secrets regularly

**Cost optimization**:
- Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for document storage
- Configure DynamoDB auto-scaling based on usage
- Use Fargate Spot for non-production environments
- Set CloudWatch log retention policies

**Performance optimization**:
- Increase Lambda memory for faster processing
- Use provisioned concurrency for predictable latency
- Batch document uploads for higher throughput
- Cache frequently accessed instructions
